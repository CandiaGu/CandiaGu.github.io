		<h1>Experiences</h1>
		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>I have done quite a bit of experience research, as I’ve worked with Dr. Shikui Chen during the summer of 2015 to design a foot-powered energy harvester. I got to work with softwares I’ve never even heard of to optimize the material to space density of the mechanism I wanted to construct. Most importantly, under the mentorship of Dr. Chen, I was able to create and research something I wouldn’t have done myself. Here’s the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1dEI7kY8AnieGU3ZEp1N1hGcUk/view?usp=sharing">full paper</a> for anyone who’s interested.</p>
		<h2>Teaching</h2>
		<p>
		Although I have not had children, their uncensored responses to life fascinates me - which is why I work with them often, both because I enjoy their company and because I truly want to enrich their lives with answers to questions they haven’t even thought of. I’ve worked as a tutor, supervisor and camp counselor during past years, teaching them basic school knowledge like math and science and other information such as social behavior to make other people like you (though I haven’t quite mastered this one yet laughs). Overall, I think the way children think greatly impacts the way I view the world—with fascination and great joy.</p>

	<h2>Hello,</h2>
	<p>
	-
	</p>
	<p >I’m an electrical and computer engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
	</p>
	<p>Although I do love engineering, I’ve done art since I was kid, if you count the scribbly mess that were my works.
	</p> 
	<p>And now, I combine both art and engineering to make cool stuff…or something like that. Please enjoy my pieces as much as I did making them. :D
