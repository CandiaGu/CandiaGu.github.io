		<h2>Music</h2>
		<p>Although I’m not terribly musically talented, I have been playing the piano for quite some time. I enjoy playing from time to time when I come back home. But it’s been 10 years since it’s been tuned. I should probably get on that.
		As for music I listen to, I’m quite fickle. My taste is quite random; I come to like songs sporadically and just repeat that one song over and over until the cycle repeats itself. The song below is my current favorite. It’s pretty good.

		<h2>Athletics</h2>
		<p>I’m not too into sports, though I quite like dancing. I’m currently trying to pick up figure skating. I learned when I was around 7 how to walk on ice, but that’s about it. Progress is needed.</p>
		<h2>Games</h2>
		<p>I play tetris a lot now. It’s scary what college does to you. I didn’t even know facebook tetris was a thing until 3 months ago. Now I can’t stop D: Someone save me.</p>

		<h2>Others</h2>
		<p>I’m pretty open minded when it comes to hobbies and am willing to try new things. Maybe I’ll try knitting.</p>

	</p>
	<p >I’m an electrical and computer engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
	</p>
	<p>Although I do love engineering, I’ve done art since I was kid, if you count the scribbly mess that were my works.
	</p> 
	<p>And now, I combine both art and engineering to make cool stuff…or something like that. Please enjoy my pieces as much as I did making them. :D
